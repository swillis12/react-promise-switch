# React Promise Switch &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/erictooth/token2css/blob/master/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-promise-switch.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-promise-switch)

React Promise Switch abstracts the overhead and complexity of using promises to store and render data in a component's state.

## Usage

```jsx
import PromiseSwitch from "react-promise-switch";
import { fetchUsers, renderUsers, showError, LoadingIndicator } from "some-other-file";

export default () => (
    <PromiseSwitch
        promise={fetchUsers}
        renderError={error => showError(error)}
        renderPending={() => <LoadingIndicator />}
        renderSuccess={data => renderUsers(data)}
    />
);
```

## Motivation

Although there are a **lot** of other components which solve the same basic problem ([React Data Loader](https://github.com/lucasconstantino/react-data-loader), [React Data Fetching](https://github.com/CharlesMangwa/react-data-fetching), [React Async](https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async), [react-promise-state](https://github.com/MichalSzorad/react-promise-state), [react-loads](https://github.com/jxom/react-loads)), none of them do it with the simplicity that I expected. This component differs the rest by:

-   Not forcing the developer to write boilerplate _switch_ logic (which component to show depending on the state of the promise). This can be error-prone and is unnecessary considering that we can accomplish the same thing by moving this logic into the component itself instead without any trade off in flexibility.
-   Simply requiring a promise rather than attempting to wrap and restrict the developer to a library like Axios.
-   Automatically canceling the promise when unmounted or re-rendered with a different request function. The `cancel` prop can be provided for libraries like [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/README.md#cancellation) that support cancelling out of the box. This makes it trivial to fetch data without having to worry about accidentally setting state on an unmounted component.
-   Not needing a Medium article for such a simple component :)

## Examples

### Canceling A Promise

Although cancelation is provided out of the box, it's nice to integrate more directly with libraries like [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/README.md#cancellation). `<PromiseSwitch />` will cancel the request for you automatically.

```jsx
import PromiseSwitch from "react-promise-switch";
import axios, { CancelToken } from "axios";
import { renderUsers, showError, LoadingIndicator } from "some-other-file";

const source = CancelToken.source();
const fetchUsers = axios.get("/users", { cancelToken: source.token }).then(res => res.data);

export default () => (
    <PromiseSwitch
        cancel={source.cancel}
        promise={fetchUsers}
        renderError={error => showError(error)}
        renderPending={() => <LoadingIndicator />}
        renderSuccess={data => renderUsers(data)}
    />
);
```

### Caching Data

If you want to continue showing old data while a new request is pending, you can provide the same component to `renderPending` and `renderSuccess` (and `renderError` too if needed).

```jsx
import PromiseSwitch from "react-promise-switch";
import { fetchUsers, renderUsers, showError, LoadingIndicator } from "some-other-file";

export default () => (
    <PromiseSwitch
        promise={fetchUsers}
        renderError={error => showError(error)}
        renderPending={prevData => renderUsers(prevData, { loading: true })}
        renderSuccess={data => renderUsers(data)}
    />
);
```
